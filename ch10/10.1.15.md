### Solutions
-  the properties of the normal distribution
   -  <font color=#FF0000>Symmetry</font>: The normal distribution is a symmetric distribution, with its probability density function forming a symmetric bell-shaped curve.
   - <font color=#FF0000>Unimodality</font>: The normal distribution is unimodal, meaning it has only one peak on its distribution curve.
   - <font color=#FF0000>Defined by the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ)</font>. The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines the spread.
   - <font color=#FF0000>68-95-99.7 Rule</font>: In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7% within three standard deviations.

-  conclusion
   - the size between 0% to 25% versus the distance from 75% to 100% is not equal 
   - the size between 25% to 50% versus the size between 50% to 75% is not equal
   - Therefore, this data doesn't belong to normal distribution!
